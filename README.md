# Car-Price-Analysis
The purpose of this report is to examine the dataset of published advertisements for vehicles and determine what vehicle characteristics influence a vehicle's price.  In the report hereinafter, I will assess what factors affect a vehicle's price. To complete the analysis I will remove duplicated rows, fix problematic values in the data, fill in missing values and add columns to the dataset, as required. Once the dataset is preprocessed and clean, I will determine whether there are outliers in the dataset, remove them as I deem necessery, and draw conclusions correlating between the price of a vehicles and other core parameters of the vehicles
